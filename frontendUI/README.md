Front end folder for all UI related files.
The UI should be something simple, basic requirements are:
    1. A simple text box that takes in textual input, runs it through model and returns sentiment of text

Later additions should include:
    1. Either a seperate box/button/page that allows a user to input a file of reviews seperated by newlines, lines are then broken up by program, ran through model and then each sentiment of each line is returned in the form of a comparison bargraph showing the number of positive to negative reviews and the average sentiment of the product.
